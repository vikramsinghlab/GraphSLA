# GraphSLA
In this work, we used five graph-based methods—Graph Neural Network (GNN), Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Graph Attention Network (GAT), Graph Sample and Aggregate (GraphSAGE), and Simplified Graph Convolution (SGConv)—to develop a prediction model for small molecule (SM) and lncRNA associations.
